# Linked-List-and-Hash-Table-Searching
This C++ program demonstrates a comparison between Hash Tables and Linked Lists by storing names from a file, searching for names, and reporting the number of comparisons made by each data structure.

## Overview

The program performs the following steps:

1. Reads names from a file.
2. Stores names in both a Hash Table and a Linked List.
3. Searches for names and reports the number of comparisons made by each data structure.
4. Provides insights into the efficiency of Hash Tables and Linked Lists for name searching.
